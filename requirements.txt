To deploy your Phishing Website Detection project on AWS, here's a step-by-step guide. Since your project is built with Flask and uses Machine Learning models, we will deploy it using AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and set up a web server with Gunicorn. Here are the necessary questions and steps to make this process smooth:

### Questions Before Proceeding:
1. **What region is your AWS account set to?** 
   (For example, US-East-1, US-West-2, etc.)
   
2. **Do you have an EC2 key pair generated?** 
   (This is required to securely access your instance via SSH. If not, I can guide you to generate one.)

3. **What operating system would you prefer for your EC2 instance?**
   (Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, etc.)

4. **What instance type would you prefer?**
   (For Free Tier usage, we typically use `t2.micro`, which should be sufficient for a small project.)

5. **Do you want the application to be publicly accessible?**
   (If yes, we will need to open ports like 80 or 5000 in the security group to allow external access.)

6. **Do you need any data persistence?** 
   (If you plan to store data files like `legitimateurls.csv` and `phishing.csv` in a permanent storage, we can use AWS S3 or EBS.)

### Steps to Deploy:

#### 1. **Set Up EC2 Instance**
   - **Launch an EC2 instance** using AWS Management Console.
     - Select **Ubuntu** or **Amazon Linux 2** as the OS.
     - Choose an instance type such as `t2.micro` (Free Tier eligible).
     - Configure the security group to allow:
       - **SSH (port 22)** from your IP to access the server.
       - **HTTP (port 80)** to access the Flask app via a web browser.
       - Optionally, **HTTPS (port 443)** if you want to set up SSL later.
     - Download the **Key Pair** to access the instance via SSH.
   
#### 2. **SSH into EC2 Instance**
   - Open your terminal and run:
     ```bash
     ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-public-ip>
     ```
   - Update the instance:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```

#### 3. **Install Dependencies on EC2**
   - Install Python, pip, and other necessary packages:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-setuptools git -y
     ```
   - Install virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     sudo pip3 install virtualenv
     ```
   - Create and activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     virtualenv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - Install the required Python packages (from `requirements.txt`):
     ```bash
     git clone <your-github-repo-or-upload-your-project>
     cd <your-project-folder>
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

#### 4. **Set Up Flask Application**
   - Set up a production-ready Flask server with **Gunicorn**. First, make sure `app.py` is correctly set up in your project folder to run the Flask application.
   - Install Gunicorn:
     ```bash
     pip install gunicorn
     ```
   - Test if your app runs correctly:
     ```bash
     gunicorn -w 4 app:app
     ```
     This should start the Flask application with Gunicorn. If it works, you can move on to setting up a reverse proxy.

#### 5. **Set Up Nginx (Optional)**
   - To serve the Flask app via HTTP, use **Nginx** as a reverse proxy:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nginx
     ```
   - Configure Nginx to reverse proxy requests to Gunicorn. Modify `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name <your-ec2-public-ip-or-domain>;

         location / {
             proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
             proxy_set_header Host $host;
             proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
         }
     }
     ```
   - Restart Nginx:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

#### 6. **Set Up Gunicorn as a Service**
   - Create a Gunicorn service file to ensure it starts automatically with your EC2 instance.
     - Create a new systemd service file at `/etc/systemd/system/phishingapp.service`:
       ```ini
       [Unit]
       Description=Gunicorn instance to serve Phishing Website Detection
       After=network.target

       [Service]
       User=ubuntu
       Group=www-data
       WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/<your-project-folder>
       ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/<your-project-folder>/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:phishingapp.sock -m 007 app:app

       [Install]
       WantedBy=multi-user.target
       ```
   - Start and enable the service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start phishingapp
     sudo systemctl enable phishingapp
     ```

#### 7. **Open Ports in Security Group**
   - Ensure your EC2 security group allows traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH).

#### 8. **Test the Application**
   - Open your EC2 public IP in a browser (e.g., `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>`), and you should see your Flask app running.

#### 9. **Optionally Set Up a Domain**
   - If you'd like to access your app with a custom domain, you can:
     - Use Route 53 to set up a domain and point it to your EC2 instance.
     - Configure Nginx to use SSL with **Let's Encrypt**.

#### 10. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - For long-term use, consider setting up **CloudWatch** for monitoring your EC2 instance.
   - You can also use **S3** to store large datasets, and **RDS** for relational databases if needed.

Let me know if you'd like more help with any specific step, such as generating the SSH key pair, setting up Nginx, or testing Gunicorn.


1. I want in Ap south 1 (Asia pacific (Mumbai))
2. I will create a EC2 instance and its key pair (Can I create EC2 before hand before deploying project?)
3.My laptop is windows OS, anything is fine (Amazon linux2, ubuntu, etc..)
4. Mine is fee tier, so t2.micro
5. Yes, the application should be publically accessible.
6. Yes, I need storage to store URLS and other for training and deployment purpose


Great! Thanks for the details. Yes, you can create your EC2 instance before deploying the project, and I'll guide you through the rest of the steps.

Here’s how we’ll proceed, based on your answers:

### 1. **Creating EC2 Instance in AWS (AP-South-1 region)**

You can create the EC2 instance ahead of time, and once it's ready, you can start deploying the project. Let’s begin by launching the EC2 instance:

#### Steps to Launch an EC2 Instance:
1. **Log in to AWS Console:**
   - Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and log in with your AWS credentials.
   
2. **Navigate to EC2 Dashboard:**
   - Search for "EC2" in the services search bar and click on "EC2" to open the EC2 Dashboard.

3. **Launch Instance:**
   - Click on the **Launch Instance** button.
   - **Choose AMI**: Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Since you are fine with any operating system, you can choose **Amazon Linux 2** or **Ubuntu** (either works).
     - If you're unsure, **Amazon Linux 2** is the recommended option for compatibility and performance in AWS.
   
4. **Choose Instance Type:**
   - Select **t2.micro** (Free Tier eligible) and click **Next: Configure Instance Details**.

5. **Configure Instance:**
   - Leave default settings unless you need to change configurations (you can leave most options as they are).
   
6. **Add Storage:**
   - By default, AWS provides 8 GB of storage. You can add more if needed, or increase the storage size later. The instance will store your model, URL datasets, and other project files.

7. **Configure Security Group:**
   - Create a new security group (or use an existing one).
   - Allow the following inbound traffic:
     - **SSH (port 22)** from your IP (so you can access the instance remotely).
     - **HTTP (port 80)** for web traffic (so your app can be publicly accessed).
   
8. **Review and Launch:**
   - Review your instance configuration, and click **Launch**.
   - When prompted, select an **existing key pair** or **create a new one** (you'll use this to SSH into your instance later). **Download the key pair** to your local machine.

---

### 2. **SSH into the EC2 Instance from Windows**

Once the EC2 instance is running, you’ll need to access it via SSH from your Windows laptop. Since you're using Windows, you will need an SSH client like **PuTTY**.

#### Steps to SSH into EC2 from Windows using PuTTY:
1. **Convert your PEM Key to PPK format:**
   - You cannot use the `.pem` key directly with PuTTY. You'll need to convert it to `.ppk` format using **PuTTYgen**:
     - Open **PuTTYgen**.
     - Click **Load** and select your `.pem` file.
     - Then click **Save private key** and save the file with a `.ppk` extension.

2. **Use PuTTY to SSH into EC2:**
   - Open **PuTTY**.
   - In **Host Name (or IP address)**, enter your EC2 instance’s public IP address.
   - Under **Connection > SSH > Auth**, click **Browse** and select the `.ppk` file you created.
   - Click **Open** to connect. When prompted, type the username:
     - **For Amazon Linux 2:** `ec2-user`
     - **For Ubuntu:** `ubuntu`

---

### 3. **Install Dependencies and Set Up the Project on EC2**

Once you're inside the EC2 instance via SSH, follow these steps to install dependencies and deploy your Flask app.

#### a. **Update the EC2 Instance**:
```bash
sudo yum update -y  # For Amazon Linux 2
# OR
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y  # For Ubuntu
```

#### b. **Install Python and Pip** (Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo yum install python3 -y  # Amazon Linux 2
# OR
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-setuptools git -y  # Ubuntu
```

#### c. **Install Virtual Environment**:
```bash
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```

#### d. **Create a Virtual Environment** (for isolating dependencies):
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### e. **Clone the Project or Upload Files to EC2**:
- **Option 1**: Clone your GitHub repository (if it’s hosted on GitHub):
  ```bash
  git clone <your-repository-url>
  cd <your-project-folder>
  ```
- **Option 2**: If you don't have a GitHub repo, you can manually upload the project files to EC2 using **SCP**, **FileZilla**, or **AWS S3**.

#### f. **Install Dependencies** from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. **Configure Gunicorn to Run the Flask App**

#### a. **Install Gunicorn**:
```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

#### b. **Run Flask with Gunicorn**:
- Test if your Flask app is working by running Gunicorn manually:
  ```bash
  gunicorn -w 4 app:app
  ```
- This should start your Flask app on `http://localhost:8000`.

---

### 5. **Set Up Nginx as Reverse Proxy (Optional)**

To make your Flask app publicly accessible and ensure it can handle multiple requests efficiently, you can set up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy.

#### a. **Install Nginx**:
```bash
sudo yum install nginx -y  # Amazon Linux 2
# OR
sudo apt install nginx -y  # Ubuntu
```

#### b. **Configure Nginx**:
- Open the Nginx config file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```
- Replace the `server` block with:
  ```nginx
  server {
      listen 80;
      server_name <your-ec2-public-ip>;

      location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
          proxy_set_header Host $host;
          proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
          proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      }
  }
  ```
- Restart Nginx:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

---

### 6. **Enable Gunicorn to Run on Boot**

To ensure that Gunicorn starts automatically when your EC2 instance starts, you should configure it as a systemd service.

#### a. **Create Gunicorn Service File**:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/phishingapp.service
```
- Add the following content:
  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=Gunicorn instance to serve Phishing Website Detection
  After=network.target

  [Service]
  User=ubuntu  # or ec2-user for Amazon Linux
  Group=www-data
  WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu/<your-project-folder>
  ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/<your-project-folder>/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:phishingapp.sock -m 007 app:app

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```
- Start and enable the service:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start phishingapp
  sudo systemctl enable phishingapp
  ```

---

### 7. **Access the Application Publicly**

Now, your application should be publicly accessible through your EC2 instance's public IP address, or your domain if you set that up.

- Open a browser and enter `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>` to view your Flask app.

---

### 8. **Data Storage Setup**

Since you need storage for URLs and other data files:
- **Option 1**: Use the EC2 instance's local storage for small amounts of data.
- **Option 2**: Set up **Amazon S3** to store and manage your data files (you can use the `boto3` Python library to interact with S3).

Let me know if you'd like further assistance on how to upload or interact with Amazon S3 for storing URLs or models.

---

### Next Steps:
1. Launch EC2 and let me know if you're facing any issues with that.
2. Once you're connected to the EC2 instance, we can proceed with the installation steps and project deployment.
